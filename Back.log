# Backlog

## now
    search in response body
        find count
        “find next” button

## later
    convert from curl to REST command
    replace “java” process name (the name in the top left corner when launching the app) with the actual application name
    make “URL Paramters” editable, take care of syncing

## dream
    Add command line capability
        to be able to do something like "cf apps", performing specific REST requests to accomplish something
            use WGET syntax
